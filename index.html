			<h1>New album cover reviews</h1>

					<h2>Bruce Springsteen - Born in the U.S.A</h2>

<p>It doesn't get much more American than this in this classic album cover, or so it seems.  The image gets right to the point with the background being the American Flag.  The background leaves out the canton and the only star is the singer songwriter also known as the "boss", standing in reverse against the red and white stripes.  The title of the album also keeps with the theme by having a blue font and is written across the top of the cover.  Nothing overly outlandish but is meant to keep the theme but not take away from the real action.</p>  
<p>With a form fitting white ribbed tank top, and straight leg boot cut blue jeans, it is hard not to think of a quintessential white biker mechanic style American.  His left rear pants pocket shows an imprint and slight wear on the top suggesting a good size wallet repressing, along with his attire, a hard working blue collar American.  In his right rear pants pocket I would normally expect to find a crimson shop rag stained with oil, but in this case you find a red baseball cap that could only mean one thing, Americas favorite past time sport.</p>    
<p>From a marketing perspective the album cover proved patriotic in every way, however the meaning behind the song "Born in the USA", also the title of the album, has been misrepresented.  If the cover suggested in any way the true anti war frustrations of the writer I don't believe it would have been as successful.  However, this album cover brilliantly shows the power of suggestion and leaves no room for interpretation even though the idea behind it (from the writers prospective) might seem un-American.</p>
